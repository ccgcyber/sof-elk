SOF-ELK速 VM Distribution
=======
![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philhagen/sof-elk/master/lib/sof-elk_logo_sm.png)

**Background**

This page contains details for the SOF-ELK速 (Security Operations and Forensics Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) VM.
The VM is provided as a community resource but is covered in depth in the following course(s):

* [SANS FOR572, Advanced Network Forensics and Analysis](http://for572.com/course)
* [SANS SEC555, SIEM with Tactical Analysis](http://for572.com/sec555)

The latest version of the VM itself is available here: <http://for572.com/sof-elk-vm>

All parsers and dashboards for this VM are now maintained in this Github repository.  You can access them directly via <http://for572.com/sof-elk-git>

**General Information**

* The VM was created with VMware Fusion v11.0.2 and ships with virtual hardware v12.
  * If you're using an older version of VMware Workstation/Fusion/Player, you will likely need to convert the VM back to a previous version of the hardware.
  * Some VMware software provides this function via the GUI, or you may find the [free "VMware vCenter Converter" tool](http://www.vmware.com/products/converter) helpful.
* The VM is deployed with the "NAT" network mode enabled
* Credentials:
  * username: ```elk_user```
    * password: ```forensics```
    * has sudo access to run ALL commands
* Logstash will ingest all files from the following filesystem locations:
  * ```/logstash/syslog/```: Syslog-formatted data
  * ```/logstash/nfarch/```: Archived NetFlow output, formatted as described below
  * ```/logstash/httpd/```: Apache logs in common, combined, or vhost-combined formats
  * ```/logstash/passivedns/```: Logs from the passivedns utility
* NOTICE: Remember that syslog DOES NOT reflect the year of a log entry!  Therefore, Logstash has been configured to look for a year value in the path to a file.  For example:  ```/logstash/syslog/2015/var/log/messages``` will assign all entries from that file to the year 2015.  If no year is present, the current year will be assumed.  This is enabled only for the `/logstash/syslog/` directory.
* Commands to be familiar with:
    * ```/usr/local/sbin/sof-elk_clear.py```: DESTROY contents of the Elasticsearch database.  Most frequently used with an index name base (e.g. ```sof-elk_clear.py -i logstash``` will delete all data from the Elasticsearch ```logstash-*``` indexes.  Other options detailed with the ```-h``` flag.
    * ```/usr/local/sbin/sof-elk_update.sh```: Update the SOF-ELK速 configuration files from the Github repository.  (Requires sudo.)
* Files to be familiar with:
    * ```/etc/logstash/conf.d/*.conf```: Symlinks to github-based FOR572-specific configs that address several common log formats:
        * syslog
        * DHCPD
        * BIND querylog
        * iptables
        * Squid access_log
        * Windows messages sent by Snare
        * Passivedns (<http://for572.com/passivedns>)
        * HTTPD Common/Combined/vhost+Combined/SSL Access Logs
        * Live NetFlow v5 and archived NetFlow records
    * ```/usr/local/sof-elk/*```: Clone of Github repository (<http://for572.com/sof-elk-git> - public/v20190102 branch)

**Latest Distribution Vitals**

* Basic details on the distribution
  * VM is a CentOS 7.5 base with all OS updates as of 2019-01-02
  * Includes Elastic stack components v6.5.3
  * Configuration files are from the "public/v20190102" branch of this Github repository
* Metadata
  * Filename and size: ```Public SOF ELK v20190102.zip``` (```1,707,502,761``` bytes)
  * MD5: ```8468fdce074445e6df6c0fcae791e1de```
  * SHA256: ```b6ae8f1f5ebc4792e6ad7d5a771316d7ab4b8855cf3928c34925b2851fb3a2a7```

**How to Use**

* Restore the "Deployment" snapshot
* Boot the VM
* Log into the VM with the ```elk_user``` credentials (see above)
  * Logging in via SSH recommended, but if using the console login and a non-US keyboard, run ```sudo loadkeys uk```, replacing ```uk``` as needed for your local keyboard mapping
* cd to one of the ```/logstash/*/``` directories as appropriate
* Place files in this location (Mind the above warning about the year for syslog data.  Files must also be readable by the "logstash" user.)
* Open the main Kibana dashboard using the Kibana URL shown in the pre-authentication screen, ```http://<ip_address>:5601```
    * This dashboard gives a basic overview of what data has been loaded and how many records are present
    * There are links to several stock dashboards on the left hand side
* Wait for Logstash to parse the input files, load the appropriate dashboard URL, and start interacting with your data

**Sample Data Included**

* Syslog data in `~elk_user/lab-2.3_source_evidence/`
  * Unzip each of these files **into the `/logstash/syslog/` directory**, such as: `cd /logstash/syslog/ ; unzip ~elk_user/lab-2.3_source_evidence/<file>`
  * Use the time frame `2013-06-08 15:00:00` to `2013-06-08 23:30:00` to examine this data.
* NetFlow data in `~elk_user/lab-3.1_source_evidence/`
  * Use the `nfdump2sof-elk.sh` script and write output **to the `/logstash/nfarch/` directory**, such as: `cd /home/elk_user/lab-3.1_source_evidence/ ; nfdump2sof-elk.sh -e 10.3.58.1 -r ~elk_user/lab-3.1_source_evidence/netflow/ -w /logstash/nfarch/lab-3.1_netflow.txt`
  * Use the time frame `2012-04-02` to `2012-04-07` to examine this data.

  * Updated all packages
* Update: 2014-12-03: This is a MAJOR update!
  * Parsing has been updated and is far more robust.  The VM cleanly ingests all known data, but let me know if there is any standard data that's not parsed correctly.
  * The VM can ingest live NetFlow v5 by opening UDP port 9995 in the firewall with the following commands using sudo:
    * ```fw_modify.sh -a open -p 9995 -r udp```
  * Archived NetFlow (e.g. ASCII output from nfdump) is ingested just as live NetFlow, so you can load historical evidence alongside live data, and use the same dashboard to examine both simultaneously.  See the "Ingesting Archived NetFlow" section for details on this process.
  * Cisco ASA events sent via syslog are fully parsed
  * Much, much more!

**Ingesting Archived NetFlow**

To ingest existing NetFlow evidence, it must be parsed into a specific format.  The included ```nfdump2sof-elk.sh``` script will take care of this.
* Read from single file: ```nfdump2sof-elk.sh -r /path/to/netflow/nfcapd.201703190000 -w /logstash/nfarch/inputfile_1.txt```
* Read recursively from directory: ```nfdump2sof-elk.sh -r /path/to/netflow/ -w /logstash/nfarch/inputfile_2.txt```
* Optionally, you can specify the IP address of the exporter that created the flow data: ```nfdump2sof-elk.sh -e 10.3.58.1 -r /path/to/netflow/ -w /logstash/nfarch/inputfile_3.txt```

**Sample Data**

Some sample data is available in the ```~elk_user/exercise_source_logs/``` directory.  Unzip this to the ```/logstash/syslog/``` directory and check out the syslog dashboard to get a quick feel for the overall process.
