# This script will assist in making temporary and permanent changes to the keyboard layout in SOF-ELK to facilitate international keyboards.
# Usage:
# sudo change_keyboard.sh <country_code>

# Keyboard country codes are typically two-letters (IT, DE, JP, etc.)
# The script will error out if an incorrect code is provided.

# First, let's verify they are running as root
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]
  then echo "Please run as root"
  exit
fi

# Temporary keymap change
loadkeys $1 > /dev/null
echo "Changed keymap for this session to ${1}"

# Permanent keymap change
sed -i 's/^keymap=/keymap=$1/g' /etc/default/grub
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg > /dev/null 2>/dev/null
echo "Changed keymap persistently to ${1}"
